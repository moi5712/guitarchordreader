[Verse]
[G]Look at the stars
Look how they shine for [D]you
And everything you do[Cmaj7]

Yeah, they were all yellow

I wrote a song for [D]you
And all the things you do[Cmaj7]

And it was called "Yellow"
[G]So then I took my[D]turn
Oh, what a thing to have done[Cmaj7]
And it was all yellow[G][Gsus4]

[Chorus]
[Cmaj7]Your [Em7]skin, oh yeah, [D]your skin and bones
[Cmaj7]Turn [Em7]into some[D]thing beautiful

'Cause you were all yellow
[G]I drew a line
I drew a line for [D]you
Oh, what a thing to do[Cmaj7]
And it was all yellow[G][Gsus4]
