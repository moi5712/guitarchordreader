[Verse]
[G]Look at the stars
Look how they shine for [D]you
And everything you do[Cma7]

Yeah, they were all yellow
[G]I came along
I wrote a song for [D]you
And all the things you do[Cma7]

And it was called "Yellow"
[G]So then I took my[D]turn
Oh, what a thing to have done[Cma7]
And it was all yellow[G][Gsus]

[Chorus]
[Cma7]Your [Em7]skin, oh yeah, [D]your skin and bones
[Cma7]Turn [Em7]into some[D]thing beautiful
[Cma7]You [Em7]know, you know [D]I love you so
[Cma7]You know I love you so

[Verse]
[G]I swam across
I jumped across for [D]you
Oh, what a thing to do[Cma7]

'Cause you were all yellow
[G]I drew a line
I drew a line for [D]you
Oh, what a thing to do[Cma7]
And it was all yellow[G][Gsus]

[Chorus]
[Cma7]Your [Em7]skin, oh yeah, [D]your skin and bones
[Cma7]Turn [Em7]into some [D]thing beautiful
[Cma7]And you [Em7]know, for you [D]I bleed myself [Cma7]dry
For you I bleed myself dry
