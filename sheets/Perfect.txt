[Intro]
[G]

[Verse]
I found a [G]love for [Em]me
Darling, just [C]dive right in, and follow my [D]lead
Well, I found a [G]girl beauti[Em]ful and sweet
I never [C]knew you were the someone waiting for [D]me

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we were just kids when we [G]fell in love
Not knowing [Em]what it was, I will not [C]give you up this [G]ti-[D]ime
Darling just [G]kiss me slow, your heart is [Em]all I own
And in your [C]eyes you're holding [D]mine

[Chorus]
Baby, [Em]I'm [C]dancing in the [G]dark, with [D]you between my [Em]arms
[C]Barefoot on the [G]grass, [D]listening to our [Em]favourite song
When you [C]said you looked a [G]mess, I whispered[D] underneath my [Em]breath
But you [C]heard it, darling [G]you look [D]perfect to[G]night

[G][D/F#][Em][D]

[Verse]
Well, I found a [G]woman, stronger than [Em]anyone I know
She shares my [C]dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her [D]home
I found a [G]love, to carry [Em]more than just my secrets
To carry [C]love, to carry children of our [D]own

[Pre-Chorus]
We are still kids, but we're [G]so in love, fighting a[Em]gainst all odds
I know we'll [C]be alright this [G]ti-[D]ime
Darling just [G]hold my hand, be my girl, I'll [Em]be your man
I see my [C]future in your e[D]yes

[Chorus]
Baby, [Em]I'm [C]dancing in the [G]dark, with [D]you between my [Em]arms
[C]Barefoot on the [G]grass, [D]listening to our [Em]favourite song
When I [C]saw you in that [G]dress, looking so [D]beautiful
I [Em]don't de[C]serve this, darling [G]you look [D]perfect to[G]night
